      <h1>Project Overview: Quote Finder App</h1>
      <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The Quote Finder App is a user-friendly and mobile-responsive web
        application designed to provide users with an easy way to discover and
        explore quotes from famous personalities. The app utilizes a quote API
        to fetch and display quotes based on user input. Users have the option
        to search for quotes by specific authors and even pin their favorite
        quotes for future reference. The app offers a visually appealing and
        intuitive interface that enhances the user experience.
      </p>

          inspirational starting point.

        <li>
          <strong>Search Functionality:</strong> Users can search for quotes by
          entering the name of an author in the search bar. The app performs a
          query to the quote API and retrieves quotes attributed to the
          specified author.

        <li>
          <strong>Pin and Unpin Quotes:</strong> Users can pin quotes that

        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic UI:</strong> The app dynamically updates the user
          interface based on user interactions. Quotes are displayed in a
          visually appealing format, making it easy for users to read and engage

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>HTML:</strong> The app's structure and layout are defined
          using HTML, providing the foundation for the user interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CSS:</strong> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to style
          the app's components, including fonts, colors, and responsive design
          elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript is used to implement
          interactivity and fetch quotes from the API. It also manages pinning
          and unpinning quotes based on user interactions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>API Integration:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The app seamlessly integrates with a quote API to fetch quotes based on
        user queries. The API responses are parsed and displayed in a
        user-friendly manner on the app's interface.
      </p>

        engineer in developing user-friendly web applications that seamlessly
